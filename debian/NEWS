firejail (0.9.54~rc1-1) experimental; urgency=low

  This version of firejail includes support for restricting the users that are
  allowed to start jailed programs. If the file /etc/firejail/firejail.users
  does not exist, it behaves as in previous versions (all users allowed),
  otherwise only the listed users can run it.
  See firejail-users(5) for more information.
